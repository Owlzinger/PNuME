# Numerical-Methods-for-Engineers

there is a course from TUM "A Practical Course in Numerical Methods for Engineers", which has introducted several numerical methods and implemented them through Matlab. "Blatt" is a germany word means task list.
These numertical methods are: 
1. `Basic knowlege of matrix in Matlab` `a way of 3d-plot`
2. `Calculation accuracy, interpolation and curve fitting`
3. `2Dâ€“Interpolation`
4. `Numerical Differentiation`
5. `Numerical integration`
6. `Numerical solution of initial value problems`
7. `Numerical solution of partial differential equations`
8. `Numerical solution of partial differential equations`
9. `Solution of linear systems of equations`
